### Async Execution Architecture
```
Event Loop → Task Scheduler → Coroutine Execution → I/O Operations
     ↓            ↓                 ↓                    ↓
 Single Thread → Task Queue → Cooperative Multitasking → Non-blocking
```

## 🎨 Design Patterns

### 1. Coroutine Pattern
```python
# Evolution from sync to async
def sync_function():          → Traditional blocking function
    return result

async def async_function():   → Non-blocking coroutine
    return await operation()

async def concurrent():       → Concurrent execution
    await asyncio.gather(*coroutines)
```

### 2. Concurrency Patterns
- **Sequential Execution**: One after another (await)
- **Concurrent Execution**: Multiple coroutines simultaneously (gather)
- **Task Creation**: Background execution management
- **Event Loop**: Cooperative multitasking coordination

### 3. Performance Optimization Pattern
```python
# Performance progression
Sequential → Concurrent → Task-based → Optimized
    ↓           ↓           ↓            ↓
  Slow    → Faster  → Background → Efficient
```
