## 🎯 Task Breakdown

### Task 0: Basic Async Syntax
**Objective**: Foundation of async programming
- [ ] Create `wait_random` async function
- [ ] Implement random delay with asyncio.sleep()
- [ ] Return delay value from coroutine
- [ ] Understand async/await execution model

**Implementation Requirements**:
```python
async def wait_random(max_delay: int = 10) -> float:
    # Random delay between 0 and max_delay
    # Use asyncio.sleep() for non-blocking delay
    # Return the actual delay value
```

**Key Learning Points**:
- Async function definition syntax
- asyncio.sleep() for non-blocking delays
- Random number generation in async context
- Coroutine return values

**Objective**: Multiple async function execution
- [ ] Create `wait_n` function executing multiple coroutines
- [ ] Run n instances of wait_random concurrently
- [ ] Collect and return results in ascending order
- [ ] Demonstrate concurrent vs. sequential execution

**Implementation Requirements**:
```python
async def wait_n(n: int, max_delay: int) -> List[float]:
    # Execute n instances of wait_random concurrently
    # Return list of delays in ascending order
    # Use asyncio.gather() or similar for concurrency
```

**Key Learning Points**:

```python
def measure_time(n: int, max_delay: int) -> float:
    # Measure total time for wait_n(n, max_delay)
    # Return average time per operation
    # Use time.time() for accurate measurement
