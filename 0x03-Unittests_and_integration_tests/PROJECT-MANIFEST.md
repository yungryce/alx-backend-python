## 🎯 Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Unit Testing Fundamentals

#### Utils Testing (test_utils.py)
**Objective**: Master basic unit testing concepts
- [ ] Test `access_nested_map` function with various inputs
- [ ] Implement parameterized tests using `@parameterized.expand`
- [ ] Test exception handling with `assertRaises`
- [ ] Validate function behavior with different data types

**Key Testing Scenarios**:
```python
# Test normal operation
test_access_nested_map_with_valid_path()

# Test edge cases
test_access_nested_map_with_nested_path()

# Test error conditions
test_access_nested_map_exception()

# Test memoization functionality
test_memoize_decorator()
```

**Learning Points**:
- Basic unittest.TestCase usage
- Parameterized testing with different inputs
- Exception testing strategies
- Decorator testing patterns

#### Client Testing (test_client.py)
**Objective**: Advanced mocking and integration testing
- [ ] Test `GithubOrgClient` class methods
- [ ] Mock external HTTP requests with `@patch`
- [ ] Test property methods and caching behavior
- [ ] Implement integration tests with real API calls

**Key Testing Scenarios**:
```python
# Test basic client functionality
test_github_org_client_org()

# Test property methods
test_public_repos_url()
test_public_repos()

# Test with mocked dependencies
test_public_repos_with_license()

# Integration testing
test_integration_github_org_client()
```

**Learning Points**:
- Mock and patch strategies
- Property testing techniques
- HTTP client testing patterns
- Integration vs. unit test design

### Phase 2: Advanced Testing Patterns

#### Mocking External Dependencies
**Objective**: Isolate code under test from external systems
- [ ] Mock HTTP requests using `@patch('requests.get')`
- [ ] Configure mock return values and side effects
- [ ] Verify mock call arguments and call counts
- [ ] Test error scenarios with mock exceptions

**Mock Configuration Examples**:
```python
@patch('client.get_json')
def test_with_mocked_get_json(self, mock_get_json):
    mock_get_json.return_value = expected_response
    # Test code that uses get_json
    result = client_method()
    mock_get_json.assert_called_once_with(expected_url)
```

#### Property and Method Testing
**Objective**: Test complex object behavior
- [ ] Test property methods with `@property` decorator
- [ ] Mock property dependencies effectively
- [ ] Test method chaining and complex workflows
- [ ] Validate caching and memoization behavior

#### Integration Testing
**Objective**: End-to-end functionality validation
- [ ] Test complete workflows with real dependencies
- [ ] Setup and teardown for integration tests
- [ ] Manage test data and external service dependencies
- [ ] Validate system behavior under realistic conditions

### Phase 3: Production-Quality Testing

#### Error Handling and Edge Cases
**Objective**: Comprehensive error scenario coverage
- [ ] Test all exception paths and error conditions
- [ ] Validate error messages and exception types
- [ ] Test resource cleanup in error scenarios
- [ ] Handle network timeouts and API failures
